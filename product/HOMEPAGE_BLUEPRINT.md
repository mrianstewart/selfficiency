# Homepage Blueprint

**Purpose:** Static, calm entry point that makes users feel seen, safe, and unpressured.

**Tone:** Calm, adult, minimal, non-judgmental, permission-based.

---

## Page Structure

Single-column layout. Generous whitespace. One section flows into the next.

---

## Section Order

1. Hero
2. Problem
3. How It Works
4. Primary CTA (repeat)

---

## Section 1: Hero

**Layout:** Centered. Maximum whitespace above and below.

**Headline:**
```
Less to manage. More space to live.
```

**Subtext:**
```
Selfficiency helps you reduce mental load by removing unnecessary decisions and systems.
```

**Primary CTA:**
```
Reduce the load
```

**Spacing:** Significant whitespace between headline and subtext. More whitespace between subtext and CTA.

---

## Section 2: Problem

**Layout:** Centered. Three short statements, stacked vertically with spacing.

**Copy:**
```
Too many decisions.

Too many systems.

Too much to hold in your head.
```

**Tone:** Declarative. Not questions. Not explanations. Just statements.

**Spacing:** Each statement on its own line. Generous spacing between statements.

---

## Section 3: How It Works

**Layout:** Centered. Three steps, numbered or listed simply.

**Heading:**
```
How it works
```

**Steps:**
```
1. Reduce the load
2. Set boundaries
3. Simplify what's causing it
```

**Alternative (if numbered list feels too structured):**
```
Reduce the load

Set boundaries

Simplify what's causing it
```

**Spacing:** Each step clearly separated. No long explanations.

---

## Section 4: Primary CTA (Repeat)

**Layout:** Centered. Same CTA as hero.

**Copy:**
```
Reduce the load
```

**Purpose:** Give users another opportunity to enter without scrolling back.

---

## Design Principles Applied

- **One meaningful decision per screen:** The only decision is "Reduce the load" or leave.
- **Minimal UI:** Text, whitespace, one button.
- **No clutter:** No navigation, no footer links, no social proof, no metrics.
- **Prefer empty space:** Generous margins and padding throughout.
- **Calm over clever:** Simple, direct language. No wordplay.

## Copy Notes

- Every word earns its place.
- If a sentence can be shorter, make it shorter.
- If a section can be removed, remove it.
- Default to silence over explanation.

## Final Test

Before implementing, ask:

"Does this homepage reduce mental load, or does it add to it?"

If it adds, simplify further.
