CODING CHECKLIST (KEEP THIS OPEN)

Use this checklist before, during, and after vibe coding sessions.

⸻

A. Before writing code
	•	What phase does this feature belong to? (Relief / Stability / Simplification)
	•	Is the user emotionally overloaded at this point?
	•	What single decision is the user making on this screen?
	•	What does this feature remove or simplify?

If you can’t answer clearly, stop.

⸻

B. When Cursor suggests features

Reject anything that introduces:
	•	tasks
	•	goals
	•	habits
	•	streaks
	•	metrics
	•	progress bars
	•	dashboards
	•	motivational copy

Cursor will default to productivity patterns.
You must actively resist this.

⸻

C. UI sanity check (every screen)
	•	Is there more than one primary action?
	•	Are there more than ~3 interactive elements?
	•	Is anything trying to “encourage” the user?
	•	Could this screen exist with less text?

If yes to any → simplify.

⸻

D. Copy lint check

Scan all text and remove:
	•	“improve”
	•	“optimize”
	•	“boost”
	•	“maximize”
	•	“stay on track”
	•	“keep going”
	•	“progress”

Replace with:
	•	stop
	•	remove
	•	pause
	•	let go
	•	simplify
	•	choose not to

⸻

E. Decision Card quality check

Every Decision Card must:
	•	Be understandable in under 10 seconds
	•	Contain exactly one Let go
	•	Contain exactly one Simplify
	•	Contain exactly one Rule
	•	Feel personal, not generic
	•	Not explain itself

If it feels like advice, rewrite it.

⸻

F. Phase gating check

Before showing a new feature:
	•	Has the user earned this phase through use?
	•	Is this solving a repeated problem?
	•	Could this overwhelm a first-time user?

If unsure → hide it.

⸻

G. Final commit question

Before pushing code, ask:

“If someone is already tired, will this make them feel lighter — or like there’s something else to manage?”

Only ship if the answer is lighter.

⸻

Final reminder (read this often)

Selfficiency wins by what it removes, not what it adds.

If the product ever starts to feel “feature-rich”, you’ve already lost the thread.

⸻

If you want next, the most valuable follow-ups would be:
	•	Decision Card generation rules (to keep AI outputs high-quality and non-generic)
	•	Homepage copy written line-by-line to exactly match this philosophy
	•	Phase-transition trigger logic (when and how the app reveals more)
