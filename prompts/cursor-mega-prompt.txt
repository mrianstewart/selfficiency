You are building a calm, minimal product called Selfficiency.

Selfficiency helps people reduce mental load by removing unnecessary decisions, systems, and expectations.

This is NOT:
- a productivity app
- a task manager
- a journaling app
- a therapy tool
- a habit tracker

Core principle:
Reduction beats optimisation.

The product follows a strict arc:
1) Relief
2) Stability
3) Simplification

Do NOT expose later phases prematurely.

PRIMARY ENTRY ACTION:
“Reduce the load”

PHASE 1 — RELIEF (MVP CORE)
- User selects ONE life area: Work, Home, Parenting, Money, Relationships, Personal energy
- User answers 2–3 short prompts (single sentence answers)
- App generates a structured Decision Card with exactly:
  - Let go (one specific thing to stop)
  - Simplify (one reduction or constraint)
  - Rule (one reusable personal boundary)

Decision Cards must be:
- concise
- declarative
- calm
- structured
- NOT conversational
- NO long explanations

Rules are saved automatically.

PHASE 2 — STABILITY
- Revealed only after multiple Relief sessions
- User sees a Rules Library
- User can select ONE rule as Weekly Focus
- Optional reminder
- No streaks, no scoring, no metrics

PHASE 3 — SIMPLIFICATION
- Revealed only when patterns repeat or user requests deeper change
- Purpose: remove systems or recurring decisions
- Output: remove something, replace or intentionally leave absent, reinforce with a rule
- NO task lists
- NO optimisation language

LANGUAGE & TONE:
- calm
- adult
- non-judgemental
- permission-based

FORBIDDEN:
- productivity jargon
- hustle language
- motivational slogans
- therapy language
- gamification
- dashboards
- charts
- goals
- habits
- streaks

UX RULES:
- One meaningful decision per screen
- Minimal UI
- No clutter
- Prefer empty space
- If a feature adds complexity, remove it

HOMEPAGE REQUIREMENTS:
- Headline: “Less to manage. More space to live.”
- Subtext explaining reduction of mental load
- Primary CTA: “Reduce the load”
- Calm, minimal sections
- No metrics, no testimonials initially

MONETISATION:
- Free: limited Relief sessions, rules locked
- Paid: unlimited Relief, editable rules, weekly focus, simplification sessions
- Tone must be supportive, not salesy

Before implementing any feature, ask:
“Does this reduce mental load, or does it manage it?”
If it manages it, do not implement.

Build in this order:
1) Homepage
2) Relief flow
3) Decision Card generation
4) Rules library
5) Paywall
6) Stability features
7) Simplification features

Default to simplicity.
Remove unnecessary features.
Do not drift from this brief.
