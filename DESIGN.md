# Selfficiency – Design Principles

This document defines the visual, structural, and emotional rules for Selfficiency.
All UI work must follow these principles. If a design decision conflicts with this file, this file wins.

---

## 1. Core Design Intent

Selfficiency exists to reduce mental load.

The interface should feel like a pause, not a push.
The user should feel calmer after interacting with the product than before.

This is not a productivity app.
This is not a task manager.
This is not a dashboard.

---

## 2. Emotional Tone

The product must feel:

- Calm
- Reassuring
- Quiet
- Trustworthy
- Confident without urgency

Avoid excitement, hype, or motivational pressure.

If something feels impressive but not calming, it is wrong.

---

## 3. Visual Language

### Theme
- Light theme by default
- Off-white or very light neutral backgrounds
- One muted accent colour used sparingly
- No high-saturation colours

### Typography
- Sans-serif only
- Large, readable base font size
- Clear hierarchy through size and spacing, not colour
- Comfortable line height
- No decorative fonts

Typography should do most of the visual work.

### Spacing
- Generous white space
- Prefer fewer elements with more space
- Avoid dense layouts

If unsure, add space rather than elements.

---

## 4. Layout & Structure

- Single-column narrative layouts preferred
- Vertical flow over grids
- Sections should feel breathable
- Avoid card-heavy designs
- Avoid multi-panel interfaces

Scrolling should feel slow and intentional.

---

## 5. Interaction Principles

- Low effort interactions
- Minimal choices at any one time
- One clear primary action per screen
- No visual noise competing with the main action

Avoid:
- Dashboards
- Toggles everywhere
- Feature-heavy screens

---

## 6. Copy & Language Rules

- Short sentences
- Plain language
- Human tone
- Calm phrasing

Avoid:
- Buzzwords
- Productivity jargon
- Exclamation marks
- Emojis
- Over-explaining AI

AI should feel invisible, supportive, and secondary.

---

## 7. Feature Philosophy

Selfficiency is built on subtraction.

Prefer:
- One helpful response over many options
- One screen over multiple tabs
- One clear outcome per interaction

If a feature adds complexity, it must earn its place.

---

## 8. Things We Explicitly Do Not Build

- Task lists
- Habit trackers
- Streaks
- Gamification
- Notifications designed to pull attention
- “Daily usage” mechanics

The product should be useful without becoming a habit.

---

## 9. Accessibility & Quality

- High contrast text
- Readable font sizes
- Touch-friendly spacing
- Mobile-first design

Calm does not mean faint or inaccessible.

---

## 10. Decision Test

Before adding or changing anything, ask:

1. Does this reduce mental load?
2. Does this make the interface calmer?
3. Can this be simpler?
4. Can something be removed instead?

If the answer to any of these is “no”, rethink the change.
